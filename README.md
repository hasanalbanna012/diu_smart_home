Smart Home Assistance

Smart home systems are increasingly becoming an essential part of modern living, offering automation and
control of home appliances. However, many existing systems are either too expensive or too complex for the
average user. This project aims to develop a simple, affordable, and user-friendly smart home control system
using mobile applications to control basic appliances like lights and fans.
